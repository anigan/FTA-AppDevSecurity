# Secure Software Development Lifecycle
Security should be built into an application to make it more resilient against attacks. Any control or solution that you apply after the software is shipped can only do so much to reduce the likelihood of exploitation if the code is filled up with vulnerabilities. In this session, we would talk about the strategies that you can deploy and the frameworks that you can adopt to make security a part of your design.

## The frameworks

There are many secure software development frameworks being used out in the world but two of them are most popular:
1.	[Microsoft Secure Development Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl/practices).
2.	[SafeCode fundamental practices for Secure Software Development](https://safecode.org/fundamental-practices-secure-software-development-2/).

This document doesn't discuss any specific framework out of the above but general practices involved in developing a Secure Software Development Lifecycle.
